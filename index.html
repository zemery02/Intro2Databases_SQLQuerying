        <h3>Lesson One: Introduction to Databases</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>There is no assumption that you know anything about databases, so don't worry if you don't understand something as soon as a topic is mentioned.</li>
          <li>This course will teach you the basics of storing and querying data.</li>
          <li>A database is a way to oragnize and store data. Databases make it easier to access the data as opposed to looking through piles of paper, or even going through an unorganized file system in a computer.</li>
          <li>Imagine you are booking a plane ticket, when you do this, typically, you give your firat and last name, phone number, age, and likely your financial information. Then, you are given a booking number that
              is unique to you. This number helps the company because if they ever need to look up your information, you can give them your booking ID, and they'll have all the information they need to do whatever is
              it that they need to. This act of looking up a ID, or number, and receiving all the data associated with that ID, is known as a query.
          </li>
          <li>Another example could be that your boss asks you for the total gross amount on something from a specific year. Querying can help by saying what you need, and then adding up the return values for you,
              before finally returning exactly what you need.
          </li>
          <li>There is so much you can store in a database, a couple examples would be, images, text, and numbers/decimals.</li>
          <li>The first step to storing data is to analyze it a see wy you're storing this data, and what you need to store.</li>
          <li>The next step, is to format it in a way that can go into a table. This is crucial because you will not be able to query if it is not formatted in a way that the program can retrieve the data.</li>
          <li>Finally, we can go about querying any and all data that we might need at a moment's notice.</li>
          <li>So, to use the airline database example, we can have tables inside the database that have information on passenger info, reservation info, and flight info. Then, a customer service worker can access data
              with a query, and relay it to the passenger. You can even join information from 2 different tables if you need to in a single query.
          </li>
